# Codility
I am taking a online test at CODILITY. And I have to use C. So I need to practise a bit. https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons

I have to say I need to change my way of thinking because C and Python are very different. Python has a lot of pre-defined Variant TYPEs and their methods. For C, I need to do it myself!

So sad that this OJ will not show your test result, and their demo test case are so simple.I need to upload my code several times to cover all cases!

Wish me good luck!
