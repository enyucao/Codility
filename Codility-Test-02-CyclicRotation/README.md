## Difficulty
I tried for 5 times to get full mark
- When I used local IDE, it is a problem how to include the custom **struct**！ ALWAYS “**struct**+struct_NAME+ Var_NAME”!
- When deal with array (uncertain length), it is better to change the original array. Otherwise, "malloc" and "calloc" seem not good.
- Make a copy by **memcpy** (with #include string.h)
- The boundaries need carefulness! I made mistakes here!
