The test cases are in "main.c"

The solution codes are in "solution.h"

The question description is in "Desrip.txt"

# Difficulty
- "Solution.h" rather than ".c"

I tried for 3 times to get full mark
- State Machine to simplify thinking
- When I use multiple IF-ELSE (I want a structure like SWITCH), I forgot to use **continue**.
- Use **strcat** to get a dynamic char array!
